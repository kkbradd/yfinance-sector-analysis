# Stock Sector Prediction Project

This project aims to analyze data from specific stock sectors and make predictions using various machine learning models.

## Project Description
The project is developed using the Python programming language and various libraries. Stock data is obtained through the Yahoo Finance API. The data is preprocessed and undergoes feature extraction for model training.

## Technologies Used:

-Python

-Pandas

-Scikit-learn

-Yahoo Finance API

## Usage
To use the project, follow these steps:

1.Process stock data using the process_data function.

2.Perform feature extraction on the data.

3.Create training and test datasets.

4.Make predictions using various machine learning models.

5.Analyze and evaluate the results.


## Results
The project results demonstrate how various machine learning models accurately predict stock sector trends. Accuracy and other performance metrics are reported for each model.

## Example Results:

-Decision Tree Model Accuracy: 85%

-SVM Model Accuracy: 82%

-Classification Model Accuracy: 88%

## Development Process
The project development process includes the following steps:

-Data Collection: Stock data is collected using the Yahoo Finance API.

-Data Preprocessing: The collected data is cleaned and prepared for feature extraction.

-Feature Extraction: Various statistical and mathematical operations are applied to obtain features from the data.

-Model Training: Various machine learning models are trained using the Scikit-learn library.
